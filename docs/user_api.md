# Capitol LLM API Integration Overview

The Capitol LLM API is designed to offer a fully managed user-based store, enabling seamless integration with AI-driven applications. This API supports making CORS requests and is structured around the `x_api_key` authentication mechanism. All requests will initially hit the user's API, which is responsible for managing the interactions.

## Workflow Overview

Your components will communicate with the client server via an endpoint that the client provides to the component. This endpoint should call:

**/api/latest /api-integration**

The request must include the `x_api_key` in the headers. The client server will then handle the request, return a response in JSON format, and pass that back to the component.

### Key Points:
- **CORS Requests:** Handled directly by client-side components with appropriate headers.
- **Security:** Requests are authenticated using an `x_api_key`, ensuring secure communication.
- **JSON Response:** After the client's API processes the request, the component will receive the necessary JSON data.
